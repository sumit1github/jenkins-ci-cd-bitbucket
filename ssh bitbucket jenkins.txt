normally sudo commands will not execute directly in .sh file. Have to permission for jenkins user
# if we are using aws, there wil 2 users  1. ubuntu  2. jenkins
    sudo visudo
        search for   "  root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL  "
        paste the line after it  "  jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL  ""
 
 
 
# connect with the server using terminal
    sudo su -s /bin/bash jenkins
    ssh-keygen
    # enter enter
    
    --> now you can check where my ssh keys as stored. You can go usign cd command
    
    
    ****** very important
    need to runthis command in ubuntu termial to add the fingerprint
    
    ssh -T git@bitbucket.org
   
    
# id_rsa and id_rsa.pub will be there

  1. cat id_rsa           ----> private key
  
  # go to Manage Jenkins –> configure credentials –> credentials –> system –>Add credentials.
      
      1. change the credentials “kind” to “SSH Username with private key”
      2.username: bitbucket's username
      3. paste private key
      4. levae pass phrase empty is not set during ssh ceation
      
  2. cat id_rsa.pub
  
  # go to bitbucket and try to create shh key and paste the public key
  
  
next steps

1. copy the ssh url from bit-bucket
2. paste it in the  jenkins > project > config > git url
      select the created credential
