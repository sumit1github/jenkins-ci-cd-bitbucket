first create your jenkins file and other files


* login to your cloud and openterminal

* install java
      sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jre
      
      
      
 * install jenkins

      wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | 
        sudo apt-key add -
        
      sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > \
      /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
      
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install jenkins
      
      
      
      
 * login to the jenkins dashboard
      
      publicip:8080   open it to browser
      
      it will show the location of your password
          sudo nano location
          copy the password and login
          
          
 
 * create your own user 
        1. activate security using jenkins own user-database
        2. DO NOT activate matrix-based security yet.(*******************)
        3. Save!
        4. go to "manage jenkins" -> "manage users" (now it should be visible)
        5. create a user. use only lowercase letters for the username otherwise you will get problems on restart of jenkins.
        6. now go back to "manage jenkins" -> global security
        7. activate matrix-based security
        8. enter the name of your new user and give him all permissions using the button at the end of the row.
        9. Save
        10. now you should be able to login.
        
        
* create app-password in bitbucket repo
    bit-bucket has stopped the username and password authentication. You need a app password.
        
        go to https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/   or click to profile > personal setting > app password
        create and check permission > Repositories > read
        save the password somewhere-else
        we are going to use it next
 
 
* allow webhook settings
      Build Triggers > Authentication Token
      
      add any string as token
      
      *** if the option is not present, then go to webhook.txt and follow "trigger builds remotely enable"
        

** needed settings for running sudo commands
    normally sudo commands will not execute directly in .sh file. Have to permission for jenkins user
    # if we are using aws, there wil 2 users  1. ubuntu  2. jenkins
        sudo visudo
            search for   "  root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL  "
            paste the line after it  "  jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL  ""
        
        

* now setup pipeline
    pipeline is the way from the code will be pulled.
        
        go to  Dashboard > hvproject > Configuration > pipeline > Definition
        select "Pipeline script from SCM"
        
        scm : select git
        
        Repositories:
            go to bit bucket and the https url
                url: https://x-token-auth:{app_password}@bitbucket.org/workspacename/porject_name.git
                it this case no need to select or create credential
            
            Branches to build
                 select bitbucket branch_name, from where it pull the code.
                 
 * build
        go project details
        enter build button
            it will setup your database, gunicorn, nginx and others
        
* webhook trigger
      webhook is a link to the jenkins url, when it will be hitted by bitbucket after push the code. The build will start automatically in jenkins.
      
            **note : First to prevent " 403 no valid crumb " inside the webhook. we need to disable the jenkins CSRF.
            
            go to " Dashboard > Manage Jenkins > Script Console "
            run "  hudson.security.csrf.GlobalCrumbIssuerConfiguration.DISABLE_CSRF_PROTECTION = true  "
            output : true
            
            now go to the webhook.txt
